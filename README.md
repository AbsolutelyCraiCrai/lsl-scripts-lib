# LSL Script Library
This repository is a library of LSL scripts written by me to be used to aid script development in Second Life.

All code in this repository is licenced under the MIT Licence unless otherwise stated in the header of the script.

Each script has a readme file associated with it for usage instructions.

## Compilation
The scripts in the LSL script library rely on the Firestorm preprocessor in order to compile successfully in Second Life. If you are using Firestorm, you can enable this in preferences under `Firestorm > Build 1 > Enable LSL Preprocessor`.

If you want a pre-compiled version of the scripts for use outside of the Firestorm viewer, use the code from the associated `.lslo` file.
